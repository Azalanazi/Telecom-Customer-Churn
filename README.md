# Telecom-Customer-Churn


## What Is Customer Churn? 
 
 In the realm of business operations, pertains to the cessation of patronage by customers or subscribers from a particular firm or service. This metric assumes significant importance as it highlights the economic advantage of retaining existing customers over acquiring new ones.

As a result, telecom companies, striving to minimize customer churn, are compelled to employ predictive measures to identify customers who are most likely to discontinue their association with the company. By accurately predicting high-risk churn customers, these companies can implement targeted strategies to mitigate churn and enhance customer retention.

After collecting the customer churn data, a series of essential questions surfaced in the processâ€”dubbed as "startup questions. Such as:

**Are there any patterns in customer churn based on gender?**

**Are there any preferences or patterns in customer churn based on the type of service used?**

**Which service types are the most profitable?**

**Which features and services contribute the most to profitability?**
